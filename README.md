# opti
n-dimensional unconstrained optimization using [linalgcpp](https://github.com/gelever/linalgcpp) as the linear algebra framework.

# Requirements
* [linalgcpp](https://github.com/gelever/linalgcpp)
* python3 - Plot outputs

# Project Goal
Implement n-dimensional extension of homework assignments assigned in MTH 510.
Use generalized [Rosenbrock function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosenbrock_function) as test case.
